# Real Estate MLOps Project

üöÄ Excited to Share My Latest Project on MLOps! üåü

After a lot of  hard work, I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed a comprehensive MLOps project, covering everything from data analysis to model integration on a fully functional website.

## Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end MLOps workflow, starting from data analysis and feature engineering to model building, deployment, and integration into a web application. The aim is to provide real-time predictions for real estate properties using a machine learning model served via a Flask API.

## Data Analysis & Feature Engineering üìä

- Analyzed a dataset of real estate properties.
- Performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Engineered features to enhance model performance.

## Model Building & Training üß†

- Built and trained multiple machine learning models.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- Selected the best model based on evaluation metrics.

## Model Saving & Deployment üíæ

- Saved the trained model using `pickle` for easy loading and inference.
- Developed a Flask API to serve the model predictions.

## Website Integration üåê

- Designed and developed a responsive web application using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
- Integrated the Flask API to provide real-time predictions on the website.
- Enhanced the UI to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.

## End-to-End MLOps Workflow üîÑ

- Ensured a seamless workflow from data ingestion to model deployment.
- Implemented version control and documentation for reproducibility.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-mlops.git
    cd real-estate-mlops
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the Flask application:
    ```sh
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    flask run
    ```

## Usage

1. Access the web application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
2. Upload a dataset or enter data manually to get real-time predictions for real estate properties.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
